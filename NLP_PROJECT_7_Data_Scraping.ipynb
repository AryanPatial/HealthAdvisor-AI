            "        \"content\": \"Metastatic brain tumorTo use the sharing features on this page, please enable JavaScript.A metastatic brain tumor is cancer that started in another part of the body and has spread to the brain.CausesMany tumor or cancer types can spread to the brain. The most common are:Lung cancerBreast cancerMelanomaKidney cancerSome types of cancer rarely spread to the brain, such as prostate and colon cancer. In some cases, a tumor can spread to the brain from an unknown location. This is called cancer of unknown primary (CUP).Growing brain tumors can place pressure on nearby parts of the brain. Brain swelling due to these tumors also causes increasedpressure within the skull.Brain tumors that spread are classified based on the location of the tumor in the brain, the type of tissue involved, and the original location of the tumor.Metastatic brain tumors occur in about one fourth (25%) of all cancers that spread through the body. They are much more common than primary brain tumors (tumors that start in the brain).SymptomsSymptoms may include any of the following:Decreased coordination, clumsiness, fallsGeneral ill feelingorfatigueHeadache, new or more severe than usualMemory loss, poor judgment, difficulty solving problemsNumbness, tingling, pain, and other changes in sensationPersonality changesRapid emotional changes or strange behaviorsSeizuresthat are newProblems with speechVision changes, double vision, decreased visionVomiting, with or without nauseaWeakness of a body areaSpecific symptoms vary. Common symptoms of most types of metastatic brain tumors are caused by increased pressure in the brain.Exams and TestsAn exam can show brain and nervous system changes based on where the tumor is in the brain. Signs of increased pressure in the skull are also common. Some tumors may not show signs until they are very large. Then, they can cause a very quick decline in nervous system function.The original (primary) tumor may be found by examining tumor tissues from the brain.Tests may include:Mammogram,CT scansof the chest, abdomen, and pelvis to find the original tumor siteCT scan orMRI of the brainto confirm the diagnosis and identify the tumor location (MRI is usually more sensitive for finding tumors in the brain)Examination of tissue removed from the tumor during surgery orÂ CT scan- or MRI-guidedbiopsyto confirm the type of tumorLumbar puncture(spinal tap)TreatmentTreatment depends on:The size and type of the tumorLocation in the body from where it spreadThe person's general healthThe goals of treatment may be to relieve symptoms, improve functioning, or provide comfort.Whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) is often used to treat tumors that have spread to the brain, especially if there are many tumors, and surgery is not a good option.Surgery may be used when there is a single tumor. Some tumors may be completely removed. Tumors that are deep or that extend into brain tissue may be reduced in size (debulked).Surgery may reduce pressure and relieve symptoms in cases when the tumor cannot be removed.Chemotherapyfor metastatic brain tumors is usually not as helpful as surgery or radiation. Some types of tumors, though, do respond to chemotherapy.Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS)may also be used. This form of radiation therapy focuses high-power x-rays on a small area of the brain. It is used when there are only a few, small, metastatic tumors.Medicines for brain tumor symptoms include:Anticonvulsants such as phenytoin or levetiracetam to reduce or prevent seizuresCorticosteroids such as dexamethasone to reduce brain swellingPain medicinesWhen the cancer has spread, treatment may focus on relieving pain and other symptoms. This is calledpalliativeor supportive care.Comfort measures, safety measures, physical therapy, occupational therapy, and other treatments may improve the patient's quality of life. Some people may want to seek legal advice to help them create anadvance directiveand power of attorney for health care.Support GroupsYou can ease the stress of illness by joining acancer support group. Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone.Outlook (Prognosis)For many people with metastatic brain tumors, the cancer is not curable. Prognosis depends on the type of tumor and how it responds to treatment.Possible ComplicationsHealth problems that may result include:Brain herniation (fatal)Loss of ability to function or care for selfLoss of ability to interactPermanent, severe loss of nervous system function that gets worse over timeWhen to Contact a Medical ProfessionalContact your health care provider if you develop a persistent headache that is new or different for you.Call your provider or go to the emergency room if you or someone you know suddenly becomes sluggish or has vision changes, or speech impairment, or has seizures that are new or different.Alternative NamesBrain tumor - metastatic (secondary); Cancer - brain tumor (metastatic)Patient InstructionsBrain radiation - dischargeBrain surgery - dischargeRadiation therapy - questions to ask your doctorImagesBrainMRI of the brainReferencesDorsey JF, Salinas RD, Dang M, et al.

Take your hydrocodone combination product exactly as directed. Do not take more of it, take it more often, or take it in a different way than directed by your doctor. While taking hydrocodone combination products, discuss with your healthcare provider your pain treatment goals, length of treatment, and other ways to manage your pain. Tell your doctor if you or anyone in your family drinks or has ever drunk large amounts of alcohol, uses or has ever used street drugs, or has overused prescription medications, or has had an overdose, or if you have or have ever had depression or another mental illness. There is a greater risk that you will overuse a hydrocodone combination product if you have or have ever had any of these conditions. Talk to your healthcare provider immediately and ask for guidance if you think that you have an opioid addiction or call the U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) National Helpline at 1-800-662-HELP.Hydrocodone may cause serious or life-threatening breathing problems, especially during the first 24 to 72 hours of your treatment and any time your dose is increased. Your doctor will monitor you carefully during your treatment. Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had slowed breathing  or asthma. Your doctor will probably tell you not to take a hydrocodone combination product. Also tell your doctor if you have or have ever had lung disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; a group of diseases that affect the lungs and airways), a head injury, a brain tumor, or any condition that increases the amount of pressure in your brain. The risk that you will develop breathing problems may be higher if you are an older adult or are weak or malnourished due to disease. If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately or get emergency medical treatment: slowed breathing, long pauses between breaths, or shortness of breath.When a hydrocodone combination product was used in children, serious and life-threatening breathing problems such as slow or difficulty breathing and deaths were reported. Hydrocodone should never be used to treat pain or a cough in children younger than 18 years of age. If your child is currently prescribed a cough and cold medicine containing hydrocodone, talk to your child's doctor about other treatments.Do not allow anyone else to take your medication. Hydrocodone combination products may harm or cause death to other people who take your medication, especially children. Keep hydrocodone combination products in a safe place so that no one else can take it accidentally or on purpose. Be especially careful to keep hydrocodone out of the reach of children. Keep track of how much hydrocodone combination product is left so you will know if any medication is missing.ÂªTaking certain medications with a hydrocodone combination product may increase the risk of serious or life-threatening breathing problems, sedation, or coma. Tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take. Your doctor may need to change the dosages of your medications and will monitor you carefully. If you take a hydrocodone combination product with other medications and you develop any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately or seek emergency medical care: unusual dizziness, lightheadedness, extreme sleepiness, slowed or difficult breathing, or unresponsiveness. Be sure that your caregiver or family members know which symptoms may be serious so they can call the doctor or emergency medical care if you are unable to seek treatment on your own.Drinking alcohol, taking prescription or nonprescription medications that contain alcohol, or using street drugs during your treatment with a hydrocodone combination product increases the risk that you will experience these serious, life-threatening side effects. Do not drink alcohol, take prescription or nonprescription medications that contain alcohol, or use street drugs during your treatment.Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. If you take a hydrocodone combination product regularly during your pregnancy, your baby may experience life-threatening withdrawal symptoms after birth. Tell your baby's doctor right away if your baby experiences any of the following symptoms: irritability, hyperactivity, abnormal sleep, high-pitched cry, uncontrollable shaking of a part of the body, vomiting, diarrhea, or failure to gain weight.Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with a hydrocodone combination product and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website (https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.Talk to your doctor about the risks of taking a hydrocodone combination product.Why is this medication prescribed?Hydrocodone is available in combination with other ingredients, and different combination products are prescribed for different uses. Some hydrocodone combination products are used to relieve severe pain (pain that begins suddenly, has a specific cause, and is expected to go away when the cause of the pain is healed) in people who are expected to need an opioid pain medication and whose symptoms cannot be controlled by the use of alternative pain medications. Other hydrocodone combination products are used to relieve cough in adults. Hydrocodone is in a class of medications called opiate (narcotic) analgesics and in a class of medications called antitussives. Hydrocodone relieves pain by changing the way the brain and nervous system respond to pain. Hydrocodone relieves cough by decreasing activity in the part of the brain that causes coughing.You will take hydrocodone in combination with at least one other medication, but this monograph only provides information about hydrocodone.

The nodules become inflamed and painful. They tend to break open (rupture), causing abscesses that drain fluid and pus. As the abscesses heal, they produce significant scarring of the skin.The signs and symptoms of hidradenitis suppurativa typically appear after puberty, usually in a person's teens or twenties, although they can begin earlier in puberty, particularly in affected females. Nodules are most likely to form in the armpits and groin. They may also develop around the anus, on the buttocks, or under the breasts. In some cases, nodules appear in other areas, such as the nape of the neck, waist, and inner thighs.The recurrent nodules and abscesses cause chronic pain and can lead to self-consciousness, social isolation, anddepression. Rarely, long-term (chronic) abscesses on the buttocks can develop into a type of skin cancer calledsquamous cell carcinoma.FrequencyHidradenitis suppurativa was once thought to be a rare condition because only the most severe cases were reported. However, recent studies have shown that the condition affects at least 1 in 100 people when milder cases are also considered. For reasons that are unclear, women are more commonly affected than men.CausesIn most cases, the cause of hidradenitis suppurativa is unknown. The condition probably results from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Originally, researchers believed that the disorder was caused by the blockage (occlusion) of specialized sweat glands called apocrine glands. However, recent studies have shown that the condition actually begins with a blockage ofhair folliclesin areas of the body that also contain a high concentration of apocrine glands (such as the armpits and groin). The hair follicles have a buildup of a fibrous protein called keratin (hyperkeratosis). The blocked hair follicles trap bacteria, leading to inflammation and rupture. Researchers have several ideas about what initially causes the follicles to become blocked and why the nodules tend to recur, but the causes remain unclear.Genetic factors clearly play a role in causing hidradenitis suppurativa. Some cases have been found to result from variants (also known as mutations) in theNCSTN,PSEN1, orPSENENgene. The proteins produced from these genes are all components of a complex called gamma- (\\u00ce\\u00b3-) secretase. This complex cuts apart (cleaves) many different proteins, which is an important step in several chemical signaling pathways. One of these pathways, known as Notch signaling, is essential for the normal growth and maturation (differentiation) of hair follicle cells and other types of skin cells. Notch signaling is also involved in normal immune system function. Studies suggest that variants in theNCSTN,PSEN1, orPSENENgene impair Notch signaling in hair follicles. Although little is known about the mechanism, abnormal Notch signaling appears to promote the development of nodules and lead to inflammation in the skin. Researchers are working to determine whether additional genes, particularly those that provide instructions for making other \\u00ce\\u00b3-secretase components, are also associated with hidradenitis suppurativa.Researchers have studied many other possible risk factors for hidradenitis suppurativa. Obesity and smoking both appear to increase the risk of the disorder, and obesity is also associated with increased severity of signs and symptoms in affected individuals. Studies suggest that neither abnormal immune system function nor hormonal factors play a key role in causing the disease. Other factors that were mistakenly thought to be associated with this condition include poor hygiene, the use of underarm deodorants and antiperspirants, and shaving or the use of depilatory products to remove hair.Learn more about the genes associated with Hidradenitis suppurativaNCSTNPSEN1PSENENInheritanceHidradenitis suppurativa has been reported to run in families. Studies have found that 30 to 40 percent of affected individuals have at least one family member with the disorder. However, this finding may be an underestimate because affected individuals do not always tell their family members that they have the condition, and hidradenitis suppurativa is sometimes misdiagnosed as other skin disorders.In some families, including those with anNCSTN,PSEN1, orPSENENgene variant, hidradenitis suppurativa appears to have anautosomal dominant patternof inheritance. Autosomal dominant inheritance means one copy of an altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In many cases, an affected person inherits the altered gene from a parent who has the condition.Other Names for This ConditionAcne inversaApocrinitisHidradenitides, suppurativeHidradenitis, suppurativeSuppurative hidradenitidesSuppurative hidradenitisAdditional Information & ResourcesGenetic Testing InformationGenetic Testing Registry: Familial acne inversaPatient Support and Advocacy ResourcesNational Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)Clinical TrialsClinicalTrials.govCatalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIMACNE INVERSA, FAMILIAL, 1; ACNINV1ACNE INVERSA, FAMILIAL, 2, WITH OR WITHOUT DOWLING-DEGOS DISEASE; ACNINV2ACNE INVERSA, FAMILIAL, 3; ACNINV3Scientific Articles on PubMedPubMedReferencesAlikhan A, Lynch PJ, Eisen DB.
